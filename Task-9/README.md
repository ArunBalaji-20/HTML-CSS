# Shopping Site

This is a simple shopping site layout built using HTML and CSS. The layout includes a fixed header, a product showcase section for gadgets and shoes, and a footer.

## Features
- **Fixed Header:** The navigation bar remains at the top while scrolling.
- **Grid Layout:** The page is structured using CSS Grid for a clean and responsive design.
- **Hover Effects:** Products have interactive hover effects for better user engagement.
- **Navigation Links:** Users can quickly navigate to gadgets and shoes sections using the header links.

## How It Works
1. The **fixed header** provides quick navigation to different product sections.
2. Clicking on the **Gadgets** or **Shoes** menu items scrolls the page to the respective sections.
3. Each product has:
   - An **image** for visual representation.
   - A **name** and **price** displayed below.
   - A **hover effect** that enlarges the product card slightly to enhance user experience.
4. The **footer** contains copyright information and links for social media.
