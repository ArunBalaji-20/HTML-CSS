# Tabbed Interface

This project implements a simple tabbed interface using HTML and CSS. Users can navigate between different sections (Home, About, and Contact) by clicking on the respective tabs.

## Features
- Uses pure HTML and CSS 
- Smooth tab switching using radio buttons
- Styled tabs with hover effects


## How It Works
- The interface uses `input` elements of type `radio` to switch between tabs.
- Each tab has an associated `label` that triggers its respective content when selected.
- The `content` divs are hidden by default and displayed only when their corresponding radio button is checked.
- The styling ensures that the interface looks visually appealing with different colors and spacing.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Click on the tabs (Home, About, Contact) to switch between different sections.
